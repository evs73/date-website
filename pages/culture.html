                    Info: Don’t be put off by the weird name, the Horniman Museum in South London is one of the most
                    bizarre and interesting museums in the whole of the city. Full of odd Victorian curiosities, from 
                    musical instruments to taxidermied animals, the objects on display are bound to give you and your 
                    date something to talk about. There’s also an aquarium and some beautiful gardens to check out while
                    you’re there.

                    Info: Greenwich Park is a beautiful spot in South East London, but the highlight is taking the steep path 
                    up to Greenwich Royal Observatory. Here you can learn about how time as we know it was created, and see it 
                    in action by standing along the world famous Greenwich Mean Time Line. You can read about the earliest 
                    astronomers and their theories about the stars and sky, and even catch a show at the planetarium if you 
                    fancy some romantic stargazing with your date.

                    Info: Located on London’s Southbank, the Tate Modern takes you on a cultural journey through the art of 
                    the 20th and 21st centuries. Take in famous works by Picasso, Van Gogh, and Salvador Dali. The large Turbine
                    Hall features cutting edge exhibits all year round by contemporary artists, which is always worth checking 
                    out. Afterwards you and your date can take a riverside stroll along the Thames and see the sights.
