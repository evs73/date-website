                Info: Nunhead Cemetery is one of Southwark's hidden treasures. It has many magnificent monuments
                    in memory of the most important people of the day as well as smaller headstones that mark common
                    or public burials. Nunhead Cemetery's history, architecture and stunning views make it a 
                    fascinating and beautiful place to visit. The cemetery is open to the public daily (including 
                    weekends) from 08.30 am to 4:00 pm throughout the winter months and stays open slightly later in 
                    spring and summer.
