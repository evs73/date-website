                    Info: If you want to impress your date with flowers or a decorative cactus for their room,
                    Columbia Road Flower Market is the place to go. Come rain, wind or shine, and even over
                    Easter, they are open every Sunday from 8am. There are also great little places to have a
                    cuppa on a cold day with lots of independent cafes and shops. Columbia Road is in the East
                    End, and if the date is going well you could always wander over to Brick Lane or
                    Spitalfield Market after, both of which are nearby.

                    Info: Hampstead Heath is located in North London, but whilst it might take a little time
                    to get there, it’s definitely worth it for the views and activities. On a hot day you’ll
                    see people taking a refreshing dip in the Bathing Ponds, so be sure to take your swimming
                    costume and join them. With views spanning the whole of London, the Heath is a perfect picnic
                    spot, and after lunch you could always head over to Kenwood House, which was one of the
                    settings for the iconic rom-com, Notting Hill.

                    Nunhead Cemetery is one of Southwark's hidden treasures. It has many magnificent monuments
                    remembering some important figures from the past, as well as smaller headstones that mark
                    common or public burials. Nunhead Cemetery's history, architecture and stunning views make
                    it a fascinating and beautiful place to visit. The cemetery is open to the public daily
                    (including weekends) from 08.30 am to 4:00 pm throughout the winter months and stays open
                    slightly later in spring and summer.

                    with a visit to the London Canal Museum, or maybe with breakfast at Café La Ville on the
                    corner of Edgware Road and Aberdeen Place. Walk to Regents Park and up Primrose Hill for a
                    wonderfully commanding view over London, or along Regent's Canal which leads to Camden Market.
                    You can also surprise your date by hiring a boat through Go Boat and show off your navigation
                    skills for £55 per hour. If you do, don’t forget your captain hat!
